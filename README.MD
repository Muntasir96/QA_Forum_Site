\f0\fs24 \cf0 One paragraph description:\
EASY STREET! A simple question / answers forum where users can log in and register with a user name and password. The username has to be unique and the password has to follow a certain criteria. The front page will contain a list of links to questions that are created by users. On the front page each post will have its question as a url, number of answers, date, and a score rating which are based on other users. The list of questions can be sorted by newest posted, newest commented, most comments, least comments, lowest rated, highest rated, etc. When clicking on a post you will be redirected to its page where it has comments. The comments serve as answers to the question. The comments can be rated too. You can sort the comments by most replies, least replies, highest rates, lowest rates, newest, oldest. This site will also have a random button that will redirect you to a random post. Again, posts serve as questions and comments serve as answers.\
